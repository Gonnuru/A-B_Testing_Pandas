# A/B Testing Using Pandas

ShoeFly.com is performing an A/B Test. They have two different versions of an ad, which they have placed in emails, as well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They want to know how the two ads are performing on each of the different platforms on each day of the week.

## About

This is a short A/B test performed by me on ShoeFly.com [dataset](https://github.com/Gonnuru/A-B_Testing_Pandas/blob/master/ad_clicks.csv) using Pandas. In this A/B test I have performed the following tasks:
- Cleaned the data ![Data](https://github.com/Gonnuru/A-B_Testing_Pandas/blob/master/output_images/data.jpg)
- Analyzed which ad platform is getting shoefly more views 
![Ad Platform Analysis](https://github.com/Gonnuru/A-B_Testing_Pandas/blob/master/output_images/ad_platform_analysis.jpg)
- The percentage of people who clicked on the ads 
- Visualized the data better by using pivot 
- Number of people who clicked on the ads for each source ![# of people]()
- Found whether user was shown Ad A or Ad B ![experimental]()
- Percent of people who clicked on the ad by day ![% by ad]()
- Compared results for A and B. What happened over the course of the week
- Recommended among which ad to choose from Ad A or Ad B ![Reccomendation]()
